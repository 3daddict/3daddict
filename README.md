### Hey there 👋
As a Full-Stack developer with over 5 years of experience in web development, I bring a strong foundation in JavaScript frameworks, HTML, and CSS, I have honed my skills in Shopify development over the past 4 years. I have experience with React, Next.js, and Hydrogen, as well as a solid understanding of REST and GraphQL APIs.

My experience with NodeJS and MongoDB, combined with my knowledge of AWS Lambda, make me well-rounded and capable of delivering projects with a wide range of requirements. I am a Tailwind CSS advocate, but I also have experience with Sass and other CSS frameworks. I have also been developing with SvelteKit, for the last 2 years in my free time and I am currently learning TypeScript to continue expanding my skills.

I am driven by a passion for learning and writing clean, maintainable code. I believe that code is not just about functionality, but also about creating an experience for developers. My experience as a manager and dev lead has given me the skills to lead and motivate teams, as well as to work effectively in a hands-on and collaborative environment.
